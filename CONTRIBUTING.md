* Always update the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/fabiomorooka/patent-corpus2question/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) file with the changes that you have done, marking them as "Unreleased". The versioning scheme we use is [SemanticVersioning](https://semver.org/);
* If any dependency was added, update the [README.md](https://github.com/fabiomorooka/patent-corpus2question/blob/main/README.md) file, in the topic; "Built With", with its description;
* If any new namespace was added, update the [README.md](https://github.com/fabiomorooka/patent-corpus2question/blob/main/README.md) file with its  description;
* Create a pull request from release branch, describing the main changes that you have made;

## Our Standards
* Use a lintter to check the quality of code;
* Write the commit messages in english;
* Write every code or comment in english;
* Local variables with lowercase letter;
* If your class will have any dependency, inject it in the constructor, then you can mock it;
* When you are writing commit messages, use the present tense; ("Add feature" not "Added feature");
* When you are writing commit messages, use the imperative mood; ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
